# Introduction

Welcome to a Yet Another [Python](https://www.python.org) Tutorial.

Hopefully you are here to learn some Python, and hopefully I can teach you something.

I am not going to get into the history of Python or programming in general, and am going to assume that you are an absolute beginner. If you are already familiar with Python you can navigate back to the [index](index.md) and take a look at topics of interest

Python installation is not required, but recommended. Most of the Linux/UNIX distros already come with Python preinstalled. If you don't already have Python, you can follow the official installation instructions [here](https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/). You will be able to run all the examples in this tutorial in your browser via [repl.it](https://repl.it/languages/python3). Unless noted otherwise, we will be using Python 3 across this tutorial.

I'll try to stick to consistent formatting and make use of Python comments (basically text in code that begins with a **`#`**, is ignored by the computer and exists solely for the humans to read) when trying to explain new concepts in the code.

Finally, this tutorial is hosted on GitHub pages (pages allow me to just use a browser to make and deploy changes), and may not look very professional (read hideous). Basic formatting and syntax highlighting is supported. I might start hosting the tutorial elsewhere once it nears completion and I have more time to spare. With that out of the way, let's get started!
